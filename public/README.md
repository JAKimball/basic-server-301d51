## Feature #1: Add functionality

### Why are we implementing this feature?

As a user, I want to view a unique portfolio so that the developerâ€™s projects and skills stand out.

### What are we going to implement?

- Given that a user opens the application in the browser
- When the user navigates to the home page
- Then the portfolio contents should be displayed

### How are we implementing it?

Complete the following features:
1. Use CDNs for content from libraries and remove the source code files from the project, as applicable
Note: CDNs are available for all libraries except Breakpoints.JS
2. In tablet view, show a fixed navigation menu instead of a hamburger menu
3. Convert the large image at the top of your portfolio to a video background or an image carousel containing at least three images
4. Add any other UI features that you feel will make your portfolio unique and personalized
